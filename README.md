OSI Model

“OSI” (open system interconnect model)

Developed by the International Organization for Standardization in 1974

It consists of 7 layers.

Each layer has a different but specific processing.

Application Layer:- is responsible for providing network services to the user it also known as a desktop layer, identification of an organisation is done using is using port number.

Ports are the entry and exit points of the layer

Total No Ports - 0 -65535

Reserved ports - 1024

Open client ports - 1024 -65535

Presentation layer: - is responsible for converting data into standard format

Document - PDF, Docs Text etc.

Video - Mkv, Avi, Mp4

Audio - Mpeg, HD Mp3

Encoding - Decoding

Encryption - Decryption

Compression - Decompression

Session Layer:- is responsible for establishing maintaining and terminating session, session ID work at the session layer.

RPC - Remote Produce call

SQL - Structured query language

NFS - Network file system

4 Transport Layer:- is responsible for end-end connectivity. it is also known as the heart of the OSI model. The following tasks are perform at the transport layers.

Identifying Service

Multiplexing & Demultiplexing

Segmentation

Sequencing & Reassembling

Error Correction

Flow control

5 Network Layer:- is responsible for providing a path for data to reach the destination logical addressing work on this layer router is a network layer device.

It's divided into two parts

Routed Protocol - Ip, Ipx, Apple talk

Routing Protocol - RIP, IGRAP, OSPF, EIGRP

6 Data Link layer:- is divided into two sublayers

LIC - logical link control it talk about the protocol

Ex- PPP, HDLC, Frame relay.

MAC - Media access control talks about the physical address, it is a 48-bit address

i.e 12 digit Hexadecimal number.

It is also responsible for error detection

Devices working on the data link layer are switch bridges.

7 Physical Layers:- is responsible for electrical, mechanical and protocol checks and data will be converted into binary i.e 0&1 Data will be in the form of electrical pulses if it is coaxial twisted pair cable in the form of the light if it is fibre optic cable.

Example;-

Devices working at the physical layer are hubs repeater cables modems etc.
